# Intellectual Property

Codiblox materials are intended solely for use during Codiblox lessons or in other commercial materials distributed by Codiblox. These materials are not available for use by anyone other than our current tutors and employees. We kindly ask that you refrain from using our materials for any other purpose without our express permission.

# Payment

## Accepted Payment Methods
You may pay by debit card, credit card or another alternative payment method specified as part of the checkout process. We may change the payment methods at any time but this will not affect any existing order.

## Price
The price of the Online Courses you order will be the price indicated on the order pages when you place your order. This price consists of the tuition fees payable to the Tutor for your child’s enrolment and subscription to the Online Course ordered by you.
The price of all Online Courses are in Euro (€) and includes VAT at the applicable rate.
The prices of the different packages are determined by the Tutors and may vary depending on the number of modules and the period of time envisaged for the consumption of the modules. From time to time, discounts may be offered in the prices of Online Courses, which will be indicated at the Pricing section. It is clarified that any discounts offered through the Website will be offered solely by and at the discretion of the Tutors, not ourselves.
The prices applicable for Online Courses are subject to change at any time. If the price of an Online Course changes you will be given notice by us or by the Tutor. Such change will enter into effect upon renewal of your child’s subscription to the Online Course.

## Payment
If you place an order on the Website, then you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you will be charged through the payment method you have selected for your order and such other amounts that may accrue in connection with the order; (ii) that you will provide valid and current information for (a) yourself and (b) if applicable, another person, but only if you have first obtained their express consent to do so; (iii) that we may use tools, software or services of payment processors to process transactions on our behalf; and (iv) if your payment is not received by us for any reason from your card issuer, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon request and using the method that we reasonably prescribe.
The purchase price for any order you place on the Website during any billing cycle is payable fully in advance. Billing cycles will be communicated to you prior to the approval of your order.
If you fail to pay any amounts by the time they become due, we reserve the right to suspend your use of the Platform. Simultaneously, the Tutor may terminate the Purchase Agreement with you by giving you written notice with immediate effect.
When the purchase price is paid to us, we will receive this on behalf of and as an agent of the Tutor, and you will to that extent be deemed to have fulfilled your payment obligations towards the Tutor.
For the Online Courses purchased from the Tutor, we will provide you ourselves with an invoice or receipt on behalf of the Tutor, unless the law applicable in the country where you are located requires that the Tutor provides the invoice or receipt directly to you.

# Delivery of the Online Courses
The Tutors selected will deliver the Online Courses as set out on your order. We have no liability towards you or your child for the proper execution of the order by the Tutors.
The Tutors are solely responsible for the preparation, condition, content, quality and delivery of the Online Courses. Neither ourselves nor any of our employees are liable for the quality or delivery of the Online Courses administered by the Tutors.
The timetable and schedule of any Online Course you purchase will be communicated to you either by us or by the Tutor administering the Online Course following acceptance of your order.
After assigning a teacher to a student, a general chat is created with the teacher and parent. After each lesson, the teacher will write a report about the lesson and homework there. In the chat, parents can ask any questions about the material studied, homework, changes in the schedule, etc.

# Class Schedule
I am familiar with the details of group classes:

- Groups are formed within 2-3 weeks;

- The schedule of the group's classes is determined before the start of the group's classes;

- Any changes in the group schedule are possible only after the changes have been agreed with all group members in a group chat or through a personal manager;

- The lesson lasts 60 minutes.

I am familiar with the details of individual lessons:

- A permanent schedule is set immediately before the start of training;

- The schedule can be changed during the training (see the paragraph "Changes, cancellations and refunds");

- Each lesson lasts 60 minutes.

# Cancellations and Rescheduling of Classes

## Right to Cancel Within 14 Days

If you are purchasing services or digital content through the Website as a consumer, you have the right to cancel all or part of your contract without giving any reason at any time up to 14 calendar days after the date we confirm your registration to an Online Course. In such case, you will be refunded for the price you paid for the Online Courses.
However, if you make use of any service provided under an Online Course (e.g. participating in a lesson or downloading any material) prior to the expiration of the 14-day period, you will lose your right to cancel. Before you make use of any of the content of an Online Course, you consent to participate in the Online Course and you acknowledge that this means you lose your right to cancel.
Where applicable, in order to exercise your right to cancel, you must announce this to us by means of a clear written statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or email) using our contact details.

## Cancellations

Codiblox refund policy allows a partial refund of student fee on pro rata basis, for unused classes,– during the tenure of the program enrolled by the student (for example, if the students enrolled for a 6 months tenure program on 1st of January for 48 classes and if the student applies for refund after 12 classes then Codiblox shall refund for the unused 36 classes which shall be claimed by the student on or before 30th of June which will be the tenure of the program). We process refunds within 30 days of receiving a request.
In the event of a refund request, a fee of 20% will be deducted from the total refund amount to cover the operational expenses incurred by Codiblox during the onboarding and support of the client. These expenses may include, but are not limited to, onboarding setup, customer service, and transaction processing costs. By using Codiblox services, the user agrees to this fee as a reasonable and necessary expense incurred by Codiblox.
Codiblox shall not be liable for any refund, if the student does not attend the allotted classes within the stipulated tenure and does not claim for refund within the said tenure.
Codiblox has the right to stop classes for a student if the next installment payment is not made on time. Classes can be resumed after the installment payment has been made.
Codiblox will request you to share your bank account details where it can transfer the refund amount and such other documents (for international students), as may be required, to process the refund. Once Codiblox has all the required information, Codiblox will process your refund for unused classes, within 7 working days.

## Missed Class Policy

If your child is participating in a group, which is an online course where your child is not the only participant but is part of a group with other students, classes may not be rescheduled. In case your child misses or will miss a class, you may request for your child to participate in another group only for the purposes of replacing the missed class or request a lesson recorded by a Tutor. However, this is subject to availability at the time and provided a class appropriate for your child is being administered by another Tutor at that time.
If your child is participating in a one-on-one online course, that is an online course where your child is the only student, and your child misses or will miss a class, you may request from the Tutor or Customer Care manager administering the class to reschedule. Such rescheduling is subject to the availability of the Tutor and will be determined by the Tutor at the time. The rescheduling can be requested 24 hours prior to the class time, classes rescheduled within 24 hours before the class will be deducted from your class balance unless you have proof of force majeure. If a student is more than 20 minutes late for a class without warning, the class will be canceled and deducted from the balance.
If you wish for your child to have a supplementary one-on-one lesson or session with a Tutor for the purpose of catching up or if you feel that your child needs additional lessons for a particular subject, you may request your Tutor to arrange for this. In such a case, any additional classes or sessions not part of your subscription plan will be charged extra.
You will not under any circumstances be entitled to a refund for any classes your child has missed that have not been rescheduled.

# Duration of Your Contract

The Purchase Agreement and the contract that is created between you and us in respect of your and your child’s participation in Online Courses lasts until your participation in the Online Course is completed or either of the two agreements is canceled in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Cancellation of the Purchase Agreement will automatically lead to the cancellation of the contract between you and us, and vice versa.

# Technical Issues

You are responsible for procuring the necessary equipment for accessing and attending any Online Courses. We shall not be responsible for the reliability or continued availability or speed or quality of the telephone or internet lines and equipment that you use.
Furthermore, it is your responsibility to ensure that your systems are compatible with the technology of the Platform prior to registering for an Online Course.
We will not be liable or responsible for any technical issues which may arise as a result of your failure to ensure the compatibility of our technology with your systems.
